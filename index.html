        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a business administration major, my academic journey has been both challenging and rewarding, providing me with valuable insights into the world of business and the skills necessary to compete in a competitive environment. My experiencesâ€”from a sales internship to working as a swim instructor and contributing at the Indian Community Centerâ€”have shaped my understanding of teamwork, leadership, and the importance of community engagement. My start into the professional world began with a sales internship, where I had the opportunity to apply knowledge in a practical setting. During this internship, I was involved in various aspects of the sales process, from research to client interactions. I learned the tips and tricks of building relationships and the importance of customer satisfaction. This experience not only taught me communication and negotiation skills but also fueled a passion for understanding client behavior. I observed how different strategies impacted sales and taught me the significance of adaptability and problem-solving in business.<br><br>

        In addition to my internship, I worked as a swim instructor, which allowed me to develop my leadership skills in a different context. Teaching children and adults how to swim was not just about transferring knowledge; it was about creating a sense of trust and confidence. Each lesson was a unique experience that required patience and effective communication. The joy of seeing a student overcome their fear of water or understand a new technique was incredibly fulfilling. This role taught the value of empathy and understanding in any leadership position, qualities that are essential in business management as well. Furthermore, my involvement with the Indian Community Center has deepened my appreciation for community service and cultural awareness. Working in this environment, I engaged with individuals from diverse backgrounds and learned the importance of inclusivity. My tasks ranged from organizing community events to assisting with administrative duties. This experience expanded my perspective on social issues and the role that businesses can play in fostering community development. I realized that effective business practices go beyond profit; they encompass social responsibility and the desire to make a positive impact.<br><br>

        These varied experiences have not only enriched my understanding of business but have also instilled a strong sense of purpose in my career aspirations. I am driven by the idea that business can be a powerful tool for change, and I aspire to leverage my skills to contribute to initiatives that promote sustainable practices and community development. As I continue my education, I look forward to further exploring the intersections of business, culture, and community service. I am particularly interested in how businesses can integrate social responsibility into their core strategies, creating value for both stakeholders and society at large. I believe that my background in sales, leadership through teaching, and community engagement provides a solid foundation for a future in business that is not only profitable but also meaningful.My journey in business administration has been a multifaceted exploration of skills and values. Each experience has taught me critical lessons about leadership, empathy, and the significance of community, all of which will guide me as I navigate my future career. I am excited about the possibilities ahead and committed to making a difference in the world of business.
